### Setting the Scene: An Environmental Scan for the Art Information Commons Initiative at the Philadelphia Museum of Art
##By Bree Midavaine, Taxonomist

The Art Information Commons Initiative at the Philadelphia Museum of Art aims to create a sustainable, institution-wide information culture that will benefit data creation, access, and preservation, and ultimately make our data more accessible to the public. Initial research for the initiative consisted of gathering together relevant projects and resources in the form of a flexible inventory. In the spirit of the commons, it is shared here to benefit the cultural heritage community at large, as well as to invite additional contributions.
