### Ask A Taxonomist...Between Two Ferns"

Tuesday, November 19<br>
3:00–4:00 p.m.<br>
Perelman Building<br>
@LandAatPMA<br><br>

The Art Information Commons (AIC) team invites you to Ask a Taxonomist...Between Two Ferns. A riff on comedian Zach Galifinakis’ youtube series Between Two Ferns and the social media hashtag #askacurator, we will conduct an interview with Bree Midavaine (Taxonomist) who works with the museum’s Library and Archives on the AIC initiative. <br><br>

Juliet Vinegra (AIC Project Manager) will pose questions, sent by staff and external colleagues, asking Bree about what, exactly, a taxonomist does, her role in the Art Information Commons initiative, and general knowledge management. <br><br>

This is a chance to ask your burning questions--even if it is “What is a taxonomist?”<br><br>

Please RSVP and submit your questions <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflMrciO5Pyy7baecTI7sd4wyGiuCWk2BhJWKZbCHrPtTeSrA/viewform?usp=sf_link>here</a>/b>. Even if you cannot attend, we encourage you to follow along on Twitter @LandAatPMA or ask us for a recording of the event.
