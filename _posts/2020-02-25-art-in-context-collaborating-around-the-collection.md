### Art in Context: Collaborating around the Collection

**Tuesday, February 25  
2:00â€“5:00 p.m.  
Perelman Building**

During this half-day symposium, we heard from colleagues in the cultural heritage field about their collaborative work, both digital and analog. <br><br> Art in Context: Collaborating around the Collection focused on collaborative efforts that help audiences discover meaningful connections between cultural heritage materials and their related contextual resources, such as archival, bibliographic, educational, scientific, and other data. Highlighting projects and initiatives that promote the stewardship, reuse, and sustainability of art information, speakers emphasized the processes that go into this work. Speakers shared and celebrated how colleagues from different departments, fields, and institutions can learn from one another, exchange ideas, and develop new understandings for themselves.<br>

Our speakers for the afternoon included:

**Carissa Dougherty**, Head of Knowledge Management, Morton Arboretum  
*[People + Process + Technology: Approaching Collaboration and Change from a Knowledge Management Perspective](/uploads/PMA_ArtInContext_PeopleProcessTechnology_Carissa Dougherty.pdf)*

**Christopher Nygren**, Assistant Professor & Director, Medieval and Renaissance Studies Program, University of Pittsburgh
