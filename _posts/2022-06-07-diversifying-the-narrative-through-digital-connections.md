### Diversifying the Narrative through Digital Connections  
### A Museum Next Digital Summit Presentation

**Tuesday, June 7**   
**Virtual**  
	
In this talk we discuss how the Library & Archives at the Philadelphia Museum of Art operates beyond the stacks, tapping into innovative, digital initiatives and practices. We recognize the need for more meaningful connections between art and its contextual information. As museums trend towards removing departmental silos and barriers, we also need to address the disparate nature of our data systems. In collaboration with other departments and external cultural institutions, we are creating a holistic research environment through several initiativesâ€“all with the goal of connectivity and diversity in the art historical narrative. In this panel, we will focus on our three most recent initiatives, the Duchamp Research Portal; the Art Information Commons; and a cross-institutional photogrammetry, and augmented and virtual reality project for cultural preservation and exhibition.
