<h2 class="pageTitle">Wikidata Authority Project</h2>

<p>
<b>April 2020 - Present</b><br>

Given the pandemic, the Division had to figure out ways to continue meaningful work during spending freezes, staff loss, and slowdown in day-to-day activities. In April 2020, the Library & Archives Division completed an Ethical Cataloging Statement already months in the making. It includes a set of enduring commitments to address the inequities that have led artists from marginalized groups to be misrepresented, overlooked, or forgotten in our collections. These commitments address content in the Division’s own digital resources and finding aids.<br><br> 
  
To continue this effort, the Art Information Commons team, alongside the Division, worked towards ensuring the digital visibility of underrepresented artists in the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s collection in external resources such as Wikidata. The team launched a project using <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/naco/>the Library of Congress’s NACO</a>, and <a href+"https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/">the Getty’s ULAN</a>, prioritizing Black artists in the collection, with input and guidance from the museum’s African American Art Working Group.<br><br>
  
There are many reasons we are looking to Wikidata as a platform for publishing data. It allows us to create or edit authority records for individuals. Unlike Wikipedia entries, which focus on narrative and interpretation, authority records establish a standardized version of an artist’s name, provide contextual information, and serve as access points for searches in our catalog, Worldcat, and other systems. Put another way, name authorities help us know that we’re all talking about the same person.<br><br>
  
This kind of work isn’t new to librarianship. Here at the museum library, our Technical Services staff were trained and certified in 2018 to be able to add records to the Library of Congress’s Name Authority Cooperative (NACO) program, creating records as needed for artists and scholars represented in our Library resources.<br><br> 
Wikidata and NACO both capture basic demographic information like birth dates, occupations, and field of work. But, among other advantages, Wikidata allows us to more concretely establish relationships between artists and the institutions that steward their work. To that end, we’ve started adding PMA constituent ID numbers from TMS to the records we edit, as well as links to any artworks shown on our website.<br><br>
  
Wikidata, like Wikipedia, is a community-maintained resource. Many of the contributors are trained staff members from cultural institutions like ours, who can enrich or correct records without having to go through a months-long review process, as we do with NACO. And to allay any concerns about accuracy, know that most information added to a record requires a reference, like a book citation or URL, so it is easy for us to verify the data if the need arises.<br><br>
  
To kickstart the additions of Black artists to Wikidata, Alex Vallejo, Cataloging and Metadata Services Specialist and Bree Midavaine, Taxonomist, created a research spreadsheet that tracked the information required by NACO, Getty, and Wikidata. They researched and completed the spreadsheet before submitting the names to each authority community.
Alex began by adding information to Wikidata on artists who identify as African American and/or Black in the museum’s collection. Alex then submitted over 50 artist names to NACO of Black artists not formerly part of Library of Congress Name Authority Records. Alongside Bree, they added 55 Black artist names to Getty’s Union List of Artist Names, which are currently available for all institutions using the Library of Congress and Getty authorities in their library records.<br><br> 
  
To further the work on making underrepresented artist information more publicly available and complete, we wanted to go beyond just adding the artist names and identities to these authority records. Therefore, Synatra Smith, CLIR/DLF Postdoctoral Fellow in Data Curation for African American Studies joined the project to develop more comprehensive Wikidata entries on Black artists in our collection. She conducted in-depth research to augment each artists’ Wikidata page.<br><br>
  
Wikidata also requires a digitally accessible reference URL to accompany each piece of information entered on the site. Synatra connected her digital source links as reference URLs for each entry. For analog sources, we needed to brainstorm a way to connect such information to a reference URL. The team decided to create a blog that now lives on our <a href="https://philamuseum.libguides.com/blog">LibGuide</a> platform to aggregate research from analog sources into a narrative format accessible to the public. Synatra began posting on the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s LibGuide page for Black History Month, publishing a blog each week on a Black artist in the museum’s collection, including names such as Alma Thomas, Roland Ayers, Betye Saar and Horace Pippin. She will continue to post weekly throughout the year.
