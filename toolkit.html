<p>Save plenty of time for planning! It will take longer than you anticipate.<br><br>
Discuss, discuss, discuss<br>
Our discussions with internal stakeholders took the form of roadshows, Coffee with the Commons--an open forum for all staff, and individual meetings with stakeholders.<br>
Establishing a place for feedback for those who do not attend these meetings can also be useful.<br>
Record and transcribe your discussions for analysis.<br><br>
Get buy-in from leadership and identified stakeholders.<br><br>
Get an outside perspective from external advisors and an environment scan.<br><br>
Identify responsible project team members and establish project roles and responsibilities along with project management strategies.<br>
A project team could be people particularly hired for the project, or existing staff. If existing staff make up your project team, you will need to make space in their schedules and workload so that they can dedicate enough time, effort, and thought-space for the project.<br><br>
Analyze all information and feedback gathered to inform Year 2â€™s vision, scope, and roadmap.<br><br>
Create a vision and scope to focus the roadmap for Years 2 and 3 or the remaining time of the planning period.<br>
Develop as much criteria as possible by which to choose test cases and prototypes.<br><br>
Use the rest of the planning period to test, iterate, and refine.<br><br>
