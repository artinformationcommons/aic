<h2 class="pageTitle">Toolkit</h2>

<p>After the first year of the Art Information Commons planning period (October 2018-September 2019), we reflected upon major activities to date and lessons learned to develop a Toolkit for institutions of any size tackling a holistic art information management initiative.</p><br>

<button class="accordion">Save plenty of time for planning!</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Thoughtful planning for large endeavors takes a while, often longer than we anticipate.</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Identify your project team and management strategy</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
A project team could be people specifically hired for the initiative or existing staff. If existing staff make up your project team, you will need to make space in their schedules and workload so that they can dedicate enough time, effort, and thought-space for the project. <br><br>
Establish project roles for each team member and work with project management strategies that best fit the team and the institution.

</p>
</div>  
  
<button class="accordion">Get buy-in from leadership and identified stakeholders</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>It is critical to have buy-in from your institution’s leadership and key stakeholders. They should actively support your project to highlight the importance of the initiative and help bolster engagement across the organization.<br><br>
Identify key stakeholders whose support, perspectives, advocacy, and participation will be particularly impactful to the initiative and work to engage them actively. 
</p>
</div> 
 
<button class="accordion">Discuss, discuss, discuss</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>Create a communications and change management strategy that facilitates active engagement and open dialog within and across the institution. Here is a lightweight <a href="/uploads/Art Information Commons Comunications Plan Template.pdf">communications plan template</a> we designed for our use.<br><br>
Try to decide what information you need to gather from staff. Then shape standard questions to gain the types of information your are seeking.<br><br>
Discussions should be focused on leveraging the work already being done and to gather feedback from across the institution. We broke our discussions into roadshows (departmental/team/group meetings), Coffee with the Commons (quarterly open forums for all staff), and individual meetings with staff.<br><br>
Establish a place for feedback for those who do not attend these meetings, and a process for recording and transcribing your discussions for future analysis.

</p>
</div>



  <button class="accordion">Get an outside perspective</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>We established an external advisory board to guide and provide informed feedback on the initiative. No matter how you shape your approach, external advisors provide valuable perspective and grounding. <br><br>
Gather and share information about potentially related tools, projects, and resources in the field to develop an environmental scan. This will provide insights about existing tools, lessons learned from similar efforts, and perspectives from others working to solve related problems.
</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Analyze</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
Establish a process for how you want to collect the feedback and information you are gathering from your colleagues. The rich discussions you are having will generate a great deal of valuable qualitative data to inform the work to come. <br><br>
We captured comments and feedback in a spreadsheet. For each discrete comment, we documented all pertinent details, including the type of meeting in which it was said, the date of that meeting, and the name and department of the individual who made the comment. We then mapped each comment to a specific column, analyzed the data in each column, and tagged the comments based on themes and patterns that were emerging from the data. This data will help inform the vision, scope, and roadmap for continued exploration. 

</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Create a Vision, Scope, and Roadmap</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
Once you’ve had conversations with as many stakeholders as possible and gathered substantial, informative feedback, create a vision and scope to focus your roadmap for the remainder of the planning period. These documents should be based on the overarching objectives for the initiative and all that you have learned so far. 
</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Moving Forward</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
Decide on one or two test cases or prototypes with which to start.<br><br> 
We took a programmatic approach as we had several major initiatives underway that our work could tie into. What strategic initiatives is your institution developing that your work can support and help sustain? Develop as much criteria as possible by which to choose test cases and prototypes.<br><br>
Use the rest of the planning period to test, iterate, and refine.
