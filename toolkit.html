<h2 class="pageTitle">Toolkit</h2>

<p>After completing the first year of the Art Information Commons planning period, we reflected on our major activities to date and lessons learned. We compiled items that we believe are integral to the success of such an initiative into a Toolkit. This Toolkit should be thought of as a resource for cultural institutions of any size tackling a holistic art information management initiative.</p><br>

<button class="accordion">Save plenty of time for planning</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>It will take longer than you anticipate.</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Discuss, discuss, discuss</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Our discussions with internal stakeholders took the form of roadshows, Coffee with the Commons--an open forum for all staff, and individual meetings with staff.<br><br>
Establishing a place for feedback for those who do not attend these meetings can also be useful.<br><br>
Record and transcribe your discussions for analysis.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Get buy-in from leadership and identified stakeholders</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>It is important to have buy-in from your leadership in addition to them vocalizing their support. This will highlight the importance of the project to the institution.<br><br>
  
Through institutional knowledge, you can identify internal stakeholders early in the project’s development. You will also notice, throughout the discussions you have, that other internal stakeholders will emerge. Their buy-in and advocacy will move the initiative forward. </p>
</div>
  
  <button class="accordion">Get an outside perspective</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p><br>Work with external advisors and conduct an environmental scan of tools, projects, and resources in the field. This will better inform the team by creating awareness of existing tools and experience from which to learn and build.</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Identify your project team and management strategy</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
A project team could be people particularly hired for the project, or existing staff. If existing staff make up your project team, you will need to make space in their schedules and workload so that they can dedicate enough time, effort, and thought-space for the project.<br><br>
Establish project roles for each team member and work with project management strategies that best fit the team and the institution.</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Analyze</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
Analyze all information and feedback gathered to inform Year 2’s vision, scope, and roadmap
</p>
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">Create a Vision and Scope</button>
<div class="panel">
<p><br>
Create a vision and scope to focus the roadmap for Years 2 and 3 or the remaining time of the planning period. This is where you will <i>really</i> start talking, moving beyond the surface layer of detail into the real, underlying obstacles of art information management.<br><br>
Develop as much criteria as possible by which to choose test cases and prototypes.<br><br>
Use the rest of the planning period to test, iterate, and refine.
