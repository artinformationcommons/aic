<p>To foster understanding of the Art Information Commons as a museum-wide initiative, we are working across the Philadelphia Museum of Art to engage all internal stakeholders. We conduct various gatherings, meetings, workshops, and lectures to gather insights from internal stakeholders in addition to clearly articulating updates and expected outcomes. Below are various ways we have engaged and communicated with the institution's staff and their purpose.</p>

<h3>Roadshows</h3>
<p>Introductory presentations and discussions or roadshows were held with key departments involved in the creation, research, synthesis, and general use of the museum's art information. We have been capturing and organizing insights, challenges, perspectives, and lessons learned, arising throughout discussions across the institution. Given the collaborative nature of this initiative, we want to be sure to track and incorporate what weâ€™re hearing, ensuring that nothing is lost along the way. All of the gathered and synthesized information will help us work towards testing possible solutions and reworking our trajetory for the initiative. To view the current roadshow presentation and initial analysis of such feedback, please visit our <a href="https://artinformationcommons.github.io/resources/">Resources</a> page.

<h3> Coffee with the Commons</h3>
<p>Coffee with the Commons is a regular open forum designed to both inform and engage museum staff in the initiative. These meetings and sessions have also produced valuable staff insights information. At the first two Coffee with the Commons--held in June and July--we facilitated a task brainstorm activity in which we asked participants to identify their tasks and challenges related to six categories of art information. This helped to identify several broad themes across the institution, provided a broad understanding of how people are interacting with art information, and understand where points of friction may exist. These insights are being sorted to more deeply comprehend user needs and common tasks being performed across the institution.
