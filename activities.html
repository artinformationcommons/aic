<h1 class="pageTitle">Activities</h1>
<p>We conduct various activities to foster understanding of the Art Information Commons across the Philadelphia Museum of Art and to engage internal stakeholders, listed below. These meetings and workshops help us gather insights from stakeholders in addition to clearly articulating updates and expected outcomes. 
</p>
<br>

<h3>Roadshows</h3>
<p>
Introductory presentations and discussions or roadshows were held with key departments involved in the creation, research, synthesis, and general use of the museum's art information. We have been capturing and organizing insights, challenges, perspectives, and lessons learned, arising throughout discussions across the institution. Given the collaborative nature of this initiative, we want to be sure to track and incorporate what weâ€™re hearing, ensuring that nothing is lost along the way. All of the gathered and synthesized information will help us work towards testing possible solutions and reworking our trajetory for the initiative. You may view the current roadshow presentation <a href="https://artinformationcommons.github.io/uploads/CURRENT_Art%20Information%20Commons%20Roadshow%20Deck%20July%202019.pdf">here</a> and the initial analysis of such feedback <a href="https://artinformationcommons.github.io/uploads/Art%20Information%20Commons%20Feedback%20Challenge%20Tagging%20Summary.pdf">here</a>.

<h3>Coffee with the Commons</h3>
<p>
Coffee with the Commons is a regular open forum designed to both inform and engage museum staff in the initiative. These meetings and sessions have also produced valuable staff insights information. At the first two Coffee with the Commons--held in June and July--we facilitated a task brainstorm activity in which we asked participants to identify their tasks and challenges related to six categories of art information. This helped to identify several broad themes across the institution, provided a broad understanding of how people are interacting with art information, and understand where points of friction may exist. These insights are being sorted to more deeply comprehend user needs and common tasks being performed across the institution.

<h3>Task analysis</h3>
<p>
From all of the insight gathering, the Art Information team has been working on a task analysis. This analysis begins with walking through the steps the staff take to conduct their art information-related tasks. We need to understand the trigger or reason as to why they began the task and what is their end goal. We also need to gather the fine details of their workflow, such as what platforms are being used or if they needed to contact other staff members to successfully achieve that goal. Other details we look for include: the process of their search; whether they are successful in that search; is there a place where they put their newly found information, and what does that workflow entail; and, most importantly, what challenges are encountered which inhibit or complicate the completion of the task. Going through this analysis reveals common and systemic pain points, habits, and tasks. This informs what tools or strategies we develop moving forward and what work we ask our taxonomist and system developer to conduct, iterate, and refine. It allows us to prioritize solutions that improve the workflow for our staff and access to our institution-wide content, all in accordance with the goals of the Art Information Commons.

<h3>Environmental Scan</h3>
<p>
The Environmental Scan is an ongoing activity for this initiative. It helps us remain aware of the information, projects, people, tools, and resources that reflect explorations and innovations throughout the cultural heritage community as well as in other commercial sectors. We use the environmental scan to learn lessons that have been documented elsewhere; keep an eye on metadata/technology standards initiatives; identify technologies that we may want to try out or assess in our next steps; and communicate with other projects that are pursuing useful outcomes. You may view a white paper on this environmental scan <a href="/uploads/Art Information Commons Environmental Scan White Paper.pdf">here</a> and the working document on which this paper is based <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19nNUfM4b5VUVshjE42zWVCCKSfHOO8-YIz3uptaXXYo/edit#gid=259792391">here</a>.
