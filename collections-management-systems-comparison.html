title: Collections Management Systems Comparison

	<h2 class="pageTitle">Collections Management Systems Comparison</h2>
	<p>We conducted research on various collections management systems to understand the options available for galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM), whether big or small. We have included ResearchSpace within this spreadsheet, providing insight from our experience with the system to date. Additional systems the Philadelphia Museum of Art uses are also included, as well as platforms employed at other GLAM institutions. Analysis includes the type of system; its possible adapted uses; whether it is open source or not; security options; whether maintenance is internal, external, or both; included tools; integration options; storage options and capacity; cost; access and search; additional notes; and links to each platform's website.<br><br>

The Art Information Commons at the Philadelphia Museum of Art has been made possible by <b>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</b>.</p>
