	<h2 class="pageTitle">Collections Management Systems Comparison</h2>
	<p>We gathered information on various collections, conservation, and data management systems to understand and compare the options available for galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM), whether big or small. We've included platforms used by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, as well.<br><br>
Please review our Collections Management Systems Comparison <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ciMT9b6aiEfLHaWZg3adSXNhfblCp9JipYDhq2Wq610/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></b>. <br><br>

The Art Information Commons at the Philadelphia Museum of Art has been made possible by <b>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</b>.</p>
