<b>June 2019 - Ongoing</b>
Coffee with the Commons is a regular open forum designed to both inform and engage museum staff in the initiative. These meetings and sessions have also produced valuable staff insights information. At the first two Coffee with the Commons--held in June and July--we facilitated a task brainstorm activity in which we asked participants to identify their tasks and challenges related to six categories of art information. This helped to identify several broad themes across the institution, provided a broad understanding of how people are interacting with art information, and understand where points of friction may exist. These insights are being sorted to more deeply comprehend user needs and common tasks being performed across the institution. You may view a task information exercise we conducted at one of the Coffee with the Commons <a href="https://artinformationcommons.github.io/uploads/CwC%20Task%20Information%20exercise.pdf">here</a>.
