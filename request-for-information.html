<b>August 2020 - October 2020</b><br>
In the summer of 2020, the Art Information Commons staff needed to progress forward with our technical work and rethink the structure of the team. Because of difficulties finding and hiring a Data Integration Developer for the initiative, the team looked to the cultural heritage and linked data community to work with an external vendor instead. We developed a Request for Information, which included introductory information about the Art Information Commons and the project team; our problem statement; and the focus on Black Artists, Histories, and Representation use case, stating that we are looking to build a prototype focused on this data. <br><br>
We solicited 19 data management consulting firms through the Request for Information process and ended up interviewing 13 interested vendors. 11 of these vendors submitted proposals. In order to properly review each vendor, we also created a scorecard, grading their strategic vision and leadership qualities, how they would align with the Philadelphia Museum of Art or what we labeled organizational alignment, their technological approach and experience with linked data, how they would engage and communicate with the team and staff, and their project and time management skills. We narrowed our choices down to three based on team scores and held some follow up discussion with the finalists.
In the end, we chose Takin Solutions Ltd. with George Bruesker and Denitsa Nenova. They suggested that we work with ResearchSpace in order to create a virtual research environment as a proof of concept for data integration with a focus on Black artists, as mentioned previously. Takin completed an initial analysis of the Black artists dataset to inform the statement of work, as well. <br><br>
Beyond this process, we worked with Takin Solutions, Ltd. to hire a developer to help us integrate this work with our website API. They identified and suggested Nikos Minadakis of Advance Services to work on the prototype in this capacity. Advance Services also provided us with a proposal that we have accepted as part of this work. We have officially begun our partnership with Takin Solutions, Ltd. and Advance Services. The timeline of the work and proof of concept for the prototype will span a year. We are excited to provide more information and updates as we move through the prototype.
