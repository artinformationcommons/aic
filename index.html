title: Art Information Commons

<h2 class="pageTitle">About</h2>
<p><b>VISION</b><br>
The Art Information Commons enables long-term institutional change in support of the museumâ€™s strategic goals. It creates new possibilities for our audiences to discover meaningful connections between our art objects and related contextual resources, supports broader scholarship, and establishes the museum as a vital and reliable source of accessible, authoritative information.
<br><br>

<b>SCOPE</b><br>
The Art Information Commons is a collaborative, museum-wide initiative led by the Library and Archives. We will analyze and document how our art information is created, used, and stored. Based on museum priorities, we will work with staff to find ways to improve workflows, processes, and the leveraging of our art information. Our work will benefit internal and external researchers looking to access our art collection and related information resources. This initiative will draw input from other museum professionals at the leading edge of this work and serve as a model for other institutions aiming to develop a holistic, sustainable information culture.
