<h2 class="pageTitle">About</h2>
<p>
The Art Information Commons (AIC) is a collaborative, museum-wide initiative led by the Library and Archives at the Philadelphia Museum of Art with generous support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. This initiative is building a more connected, holistic, and sustainable model using <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data"><b>linked data</b></a> for the creation, research, and storage of our art information at the museum. To create a sustainable model, we worked across departments to understand, document, and analyze their art information and research workflows. This way, we could build a prototype for holistic art information, putting user needs first. We have also sought input from external experts and other museum professionals at the leading edge of this work. Although the prototype we are developing is currently only available to staff, we are researching and incorporating local community perspectives and our long-term goal is to expose our linked data as <a href="https://www.w3.org/egov/wiki/Linked_Open_Data"><b>linked open data</b></a>.<br><br>

The Art Information Commons prototype is a subset of the museum’s data, focused on Black artists, histories, and representation. This includes data and art historical information on Black artists, Black history and life as it relates to the museum and its collection, how Black individuals are represented within artworks, and the collection’s connection to the Enslavement period, such as enslaved artists and materials within our collection that come from the slave trade.<br><br>  

After research interviews with staff, data was gathered from internal systems, modeled based on the Linked.Art linked data model, ingested into, and now searchable in a single virtual research environment.<br><br> 

These are the statistics on the data type and source system:
<ul class="roman">
 <li>TMS
 <ul class="square">
  <li>TMS Artwork records - 136,120</li>
  <li>TMS Constituent Records - 35,864</li>
  <li>TMS Exhibition Records - 1,989 </li>
  </ul>
 <li>MARC Records - 151,231</li><br>
  <li>Conservation Records - 957</li><br>
<li>Archival Records - 5,577</li><br>
 <li>Information Outside of Source Systems
  <ul class="roman">
  <li>Education Materials - 35</li>
    <ul class="square">
</ul>

The virtual research environment is built using the open source tool ResearchSpace and surfaces, connects, and makes data more accessible and transparent to museum staff. In addition, it’s a platform where staff will be able to create new research leading to the development of a richer, more diverse narrative around our art objects. 

<br><br>This iteration of the initiative will help us identify, contextualize, and correct inequities in our collection data, but will also provide information on the tangible costs for maintenance and staffing for fully integrating the prototype into our daily workflows. As a result, we will work to fill in the research gaps and improve the prototype, continuing to partner and collaborate with staff researchers during user testing and training. The results of the Art Information Commons prototype will inform us on how to address other underrepresented areas of our art information and, ultimately, be extensible to the rest of the collection.
