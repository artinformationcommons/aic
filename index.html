<h1 class="pageTitle">About</h1>
<p>The Art Information Commons aims to improve how the Philadelphia Museum of Art creates, stores, connects, uses, and accesses the full extent of the museum’s collection resources. Our goal is to assist information seekers in finding relevant content and discovering meaningful connections between our art object information and related contextual resources. Enabling long-term institutional change in support of the museum’s strategic direction, we are identifying and building sustainable skills, tools, working practices, and governance structures for the intentional, coordinated stewardship of the museum’s art information.</p>
