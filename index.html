<h1 class="pageTitle">About</h1>
<p>In 2018, Philadelphia Museum of Art received a three-year planning grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support holistic management of collections-related data.<br>
In its second year, the Art Information Commons is an internally-focused, museum-wide, collaborative initiative led by the Library and Archives. We aim to improve how the institution creates, stores, connects, uses, and accesses the full extent of the museum’s collection resources. In doing so, we would assist information seekers in finding relevant content and discovering meaningful connections between our art object information and related contextual resources. We will enable long-term institutional change in support of PMA’s strategic direction. To aid such change, we will identify and build sustainable skills, tools, working practices, and governance structures for the intentional, coordinated stewardship of the museum’s art information.  </p>
