<h2 class="pageTitle">About</h2>
<p>In 2018, Philadelphia Museum of Art received a three-year planning grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support holistic management of collections-related data. The Art Information Commons has a broad focus on enhancing information management practices across resources, systems, and professional disciplines. </p>

<h3>What is the goal?</h3>
<p>This initiative will enhance the art information management culture at Philadelphia Museum of Art through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a collective understanding among staff about emerging best practices for art information management, including linked open data, information management roles, metadata creation, interoperability, and digital publishing. </li>
<li>Examine data integration potentials across the museum's various digital information resources- library and archives, curatorial and registrar files, collection and image databases, and conservation records. </li>
<li>Prototype infrastructure for improved data integration and sharing resources as linked data. </li>
