<h2 class="pageTitle">About</h2>
<p>The Art Information Commons Initiative at the Philadelphia Museum of Art aims to create a sustainable, institution-wide information culture that will benefit data creation, access, and preservation, and ultimately make our data more accessible to the public.
<br><br>
This initiative will enhance art information management through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a collective understanding among staff about emerging best practices for art information management, including linked open data, information management roles, metadata creation, interoperability, and digital publishing. </li>
<li>Examining data integration potentials across the museum's various digital information resources- library and archives, curatorial and registrar files, collection and image databases, and conservation records. </li>
<li>Prototyping infrastructure for improved data integration and sharing resources as linked data. </li>
  </ul>
