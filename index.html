<h2 class="pageTitle">About</h2>
<p><b>VISION</b><br>
The Art Information Commons enables long-term institutional change in support of the museum’s strategic goals. It creates new possibilities for our audiences to discover meaningful connections between our art objects and related contextual resources, supports broader scholarship, and establishes the museum as a vital and reliable source of accessible, authoritative information.
<br><br>

<b>SCOPE</b><br>
The Art Information Commons is a collaborative, museum-wide initiative led by the Library and Archives. We are analyzing and documenting how our art information is created, used, and stored. Based on museum priorities, we are working with staff to find ways to improve workflows, processes, and the leveraging of our art information. Our work will benefit internal and external researchers looking to access our art collection and related information resources. This initiative draws input from other museum professionals at the leading edge of this work and serves as a model for other institutions aiming to develop a holistic, sustainable information culture.
<br><br>
  
<b>PROTOTYPE</b><br>
Our current focus for the initiative is data and art historical information as it relates to Black artists, histories, and representation within the museum’s collection. The team is using this slice of information to create and test a linked data prototype in a system called <a href="https://www.researchspace.org/index.html">ResearchSpace</a>. This includes surfacing, connecting, and making more accessible the diverse research created by staff across the museum. This iteration of the initiative will help us understand not only how to address inequities in our collection data, but also fully understand the inequities that exist. The results of the prototype should inform us on how to address other underrepresented areas of our art information and, ultimately, be extensible to the rest of the collection.  <br><br>

We are using the term Black, with a capital B, because the term is a more inclusive and preferred term than African American when referring to people of African descent, regardless of where they or their parents were born. Black refers to a shared ancestry and experiences and allows us to include both African Americans, those who are the descendants of formerly enslaved people in the United States, and immigrants of African descent from other countries and their descendants.
