	The Art Information Commons (AIC) aims to leverage institution-wide standards for how information about individual works of art can be linked to related contextual information—such as archival materials, bibliographic references, exhibition labels, provenance documentation, conservation records, interpretive content, curatorial research files, and non-object images such as exhibition photography. This planning phase is part of an organization-wide evolution in how we holistically manage our collections-related data and support a sustainable information culture—an Art Information Commons—that spans the entire organization and will benefit data creation, access, and preservation for years to come.
